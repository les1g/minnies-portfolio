# About
This project is a four-page website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is deployed with GitHub Pages. Its purpose is to showcase web development fundamentals in a fun way by creating a portfolio website for Minnie Mouse, styled as if she were a fashion professional.

* **Resume Page**: Displays her "professional experience" using tables and lists.  

* **Cover Letter Page**: Provides a personal introduction with styled typography.  

* **Career Goals Page**: Includes media elements (video/audio) and a working contact form.  

# What I Learned
This project helped me practice writing clean, semantic HTML5, styling with CSS (including flexbox, gradients, and variables), and making responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes. I also gained experience with Git for version control, deploying with GitHub Pages, and adding interactive elements like hover effects and smooth transitions.
