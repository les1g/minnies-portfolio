# Minnie Mouse Portfolio Website

This is a fun school project I created to showcase my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. I decided to make a portfolio website for Minnie Mouse as a creative way to demonstrate web development fundamentals while keeping it entertaining.

## About This Project

For my web development class, I needed to create a multi-page website that showed I could handle HTML structure, CSS styling, and basic JavaScript. Instead of making another boring personal portfolio, I thought it would be more interesting to create one for Minnie Mouse as if she were a fashion professional.

## Live Website

You can check out the live site here: https://les1g.github.io/minnies-portfolio/

## What's Included

The website has four main pages:
- Homepage with navigation and introduction
- Resume page showing her "professional experience" 
- Cover letter page with a personal introduction
- Career goals page with media elements and a contact form

## Technical Stuff I Learned

This project helped me practice:
- Writing clean, semantic HTML5
- CSS styling with modern techniques like flexbox and gradients
- Making responsive designs that work on phones and computers
- Using Git for version control
- Deploying websites with GitHub Pages
- Adding interactive elements and hover effects

## Design Choices

I went with a pink color scheme since it fits Minnie's character. The design uses:
- Card-based layout with shadows
- Gradient backgrounds
- Smooth animations when you hover over things
- Sticky navigation that stays at the top when you scroll
- Forms that actually work and look modern

```

## What I Built

Each page demonstrates different skills:
- Index page: Navigation and layout basics
- Resume: Tables, lists, and structured content
- Cover letter: Typography and text formatting  
- Career goals: Forms, media elements (video/audio), and interactivity

The CSS includes modern features like CSS variables, flexbox layouts, smooth transitions, and responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Deployment

I used GitHub Pages to host the site for free. It automatically updates whenever I push changes to the main branch, which is pretty convenient for a student project.

## Reflection

This was a good learning experience because it let me be creative while still hitting all the technical requirements. Working with a fun theme like Minnie Mouse made the project more enjoyable than just building another generic portfolio site.

The biggest challenges were getting the responsive design right and making sure all the animations worked smoothly across different browsers. I also learned a lot about organizing CSS code and keeping everything maintainable.

## Future Ideas

If I continue working on this, I might add:
- More JavaScript interactivity
- A dark mode option
- Better form validation
- Some scroll animations
- Maybe a blog section

This project shows I can build a complete website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while keeping it visually appealing and user-friendly.
