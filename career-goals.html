        <p>
            As a lifelong fashion enthusiast and iconic style figure, I’m always dreaming big. 
            My career goals are built on creativity, compassion, and the desire to make the 
            world just a little more fabulous—one outfit at a time!
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Here are some of my aspirations for the future:</strong></p>
          
        <ul>
            <li>Launch my own signature clothing line inspired by classic Disney glamour and modern trends.</li>
            <li>Promote sustainable fashion practices in my designs and encourage eco-conscious choices.</li>
            <li>Collaborate with up-and-coming designers and support diverse voices in fashion.</li>
            <li>Host a fashion talk show or mini-series to inspire young creatives around the world.</li>
            <li>Design exclusive red carpet looks for award shows and royal Disney events.</li>
            <li>Mentor the next generation of fashion designers through internships and workshops.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            I believe that fashion is more than fabric — it’s confidence, culture, and 
            storytelling. My dream is to continue designing with heart, while 
            leaving a little sparkle wherever I go.
