            <p>
                As a lifelong fashion enthusiast and iconic style figure, I’m always dreaming big. 
                My career goals are built on creativity, compassion, and the desire to make the 
                world just a little more fabulous—one outfit at a time! <br>
                <ul>
                    <strong>Here are some of my aspirations for the future:</strong>
                    <li>
                        Launch my own signature clothing line inspired by classic Disney glamour 
                        and modern trends.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Promote sustainable fashion practices in my designs and encourage 
                        eco-conscious choices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Collaborate with up-and-coming designers and support diverse voices in fashion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Host a fashion talk show or mini-series to inspire young creatives around the world.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Design exclusive red carpet looks for award shows and royal Disney events.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mentor the next generation of fashion designers through internships and workshops.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
                <br>I believe that fashion is more than fabric — it’s confidence, culture, and 
                storytelling. My dream is to continue designing with heart, while 
                leaving a little sparkle wherever I go. </p>
